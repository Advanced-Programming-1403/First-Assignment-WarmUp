# First Assignment - WarmUp

Welcome back to coding!  
Let's kick things off by solving three basic problems to refresh your knowledge of *Java* and *Git*.


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your project:

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

Fork this repo and clone it to your local machine via Git:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### 2. Enable GitHub Actions

- Go to the **Actions** tab of your forked repo.  
- Enable workflows to let GitHub automatically run test cases.

### 3. Complete the Tasks

- Implement the required code based on the comments in the given files.  
- The project structure looks like this:

```
src
├── main
│   ├── java
│   │   └── Exercises.java
│   └── resources
└── test
    └── java
        ├── TestFib.java
        ├── TestPrime.java
        └── TestTriangle.java
```

- Each file under `test/java` should be executed, and all test cases must pass to confirm your solutions work properly.

### 4. Commit Your Work Locally

To stage and commit files, use the following Git commands:  

- **Stage a specific file:**
  ```bash
  git add <file_name>
  ```

- **Stage all files at once:**
  ```bash
  git add .
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  git add -A
  ```

- **Commit changes:**  
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
  ```

### 5. Push to Remote Repo

```bash
git push origin main
```

### 6. Share with Your Mentor  

- Add your mentor as a collaborator to your forked repo.  
- Push the final commit before the deadline.
