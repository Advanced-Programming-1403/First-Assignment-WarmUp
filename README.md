# First Assignment - WarmUp

Welcome back to coding!
Let's start by solving these three basic problems in order to become more familiar with *Java* and *Git*.

## Getting Started ðŸš€

1. You need to fork this repo and through the link in your github page, clone it on your own computer:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. In the *Actions* tab of your repo, enable workflows to let github run the test-cases.

3. Complete the code and do the tasks given in comments, then test your code as described there. Project structure will be like:

```
src
+-- main
|   +-- java
|   |   +-- Exercises.java
|   +-- resources
+-- test
|   +-- java
|   |   +-- TestFib.java
|   |   +-- TestPrime.java
|   |   +-- TestTriangle.java
```

Every file in ```test\java``` should be run and every test case should be passed to show your code is working properly.

4. Successfully done the tasks, commit your changes on your local git.

to stage a file in git:
```
git add <file_name>
```

you can stage all of the at one by:
```
git add .
```

or
```
git add -A
```

5. Push the commits to remote repo:
```
git push origin main
```

**Note:** You should add your mentor as a collaborator to the forked repo and push the final commit untill the deadline.

## Prerequisites âœ…

Before starting to work on this exercise, make sure you have:
- basic knowledge of Java
- enough fluency in Git
